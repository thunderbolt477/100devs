//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let arr = ["shawshank redemption", "moneyball", "initial d"];

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let movie1 = arr[0];

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let length = arr.length;

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastMovie = arr[arr.length - 1];
